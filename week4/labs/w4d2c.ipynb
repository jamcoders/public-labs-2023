Thus, it allows us to find the shortest path between any two nodes.\n","\n","Edges connecting the nodes in a graph are weighted with a number. The weights can represent the \"cost\" to travel between the two nodes via that edge.\n","\n","For example, to get from UWI Mona to Downtown Kingston, there are many paths. UWI Mona and Downtown Kingston are nodes in a graph. The different streets are edges. Each street might take a different amount of time, so the weight of the edges in the graph represent time in this example.

Edge $A \\to B$: We know the shortest path to $A$ has $0$ distance (by looking up that distance in the distance dictionary). The edge $A \\to B$ has length $6$, so there exists a path from the source node $A$ to $B$ with length $6 = 0 \\text{ (distance from $A$)} + 6 \\text{ (length of edge $A \\to B$)}$.
