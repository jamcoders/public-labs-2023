    "Recursion is tough. And you may think that most of the examples you have seen of recursion can be easily replaced with different code using `for` loops. However, it is a powerful tool that we can use to solve some complicated problems very cleanly. We will see some examples of these in the days to come, and you might be surprised how elegant a recursive solution can be! \n",
