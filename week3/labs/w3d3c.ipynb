    "Consider dividing our range into three pieces: n1 to x, x to y, y to n2, for n1 < x < y < n2. If f(x) > f(y), we know that the minimizer cannot come before x: if it came before, then we would have f(x) <= f(y). Similarly, if we have f(x) < f(y), we know that the minimizer cannot come after y. If f(x) = f(y), then the minimizer must be in between x and y.\n",

If we calculate x = floor(n1 + (n2-n1)/3) and y = ceil(n1 + 2*(n2-n1)/3), we divide our range into a smaller range of roughly two thirds the size. When the range is small enough that the size no longer decreases, then we can just check all values left in the range (like we did in the `linear_minimizer` function). \n",
